## 1. Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have its primary responsibilities and should not take others responsibilities.

### Anti-pattern
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def get_current_grades(self, signature): 
        pass
```

### Pattern

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class StudentGrades:
    def __init__(self, student):
        self.student = student
    
    def get_grade(self, signature): 
        pass
```

## 2. Open-Closed Principle

Open for extension, closed for modification.
We should try to avoid extending the methods of the class in order to create related functionalities, instead, look for the extension of the class inheriting a base one.

### Anti-pattern
```python
class Store:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def get_item(self, item):
        pass
    def get_item_by_name(self, name):
        pass
    def get_item_by_id(self, id):
        pass
```

### Pattern
```python
class Store:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Specification:
    def is_satisfied(self, item):
        pass
    
class Filter:
    def filter(self, items, specification):
        for item in items:
            if specification.is_satisfied(item):
                yield item

class ItemNameSpecification(Specification):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def is_satisfied(self, item):
        return item.name == self.name

```

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle

if you use inheritance the methods working on the base class, should not have different result in the new classes

### Pattern
```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y


class ScientificCalculator(Calculator):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        pass

    def power(self, x, n):
        return x ** n


my_cal = ScientificCalculator(name='test')
my_cal.add(5, 6) # this should work as expected
```

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle

Instead of having one large interface with several methods in it, you should make it granular and make smallers interfaces

### Anti-pattern
```python
class Machine:
    def print(self, document):
        pass
    def scan(self, document):
        pass
    def fax(self, document):
        pass
```

### Pattern
```python
class Printer:
    def print(self, document):
        pass

class Scanner:
    def scan(self, document):
        pass
    
class Fax:
    def fax(self, document):
        pass

## Use them to create the higher level class

class MyPrinter(Printer):
    def print(self, document):
        print(document)

class Photocopier(Printer, Scanner):
    def print(self, document):
        Printer.print(document)
    
    def scan(self, document):
        pass
```

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

High level modules should not depend on low level modules, instead, it should depend on abstractions

### Anti-pattern
```python
from enum import Enum


class Relationship(Enum):
    PARENT = 0
    CHILD = 1
    SIBLING = 2


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Relationships:  # low-level
    def __init__(self):
        self.relations = []

    def add_parent_and_child(self, parent, child):
        self.relations.append((parent, Relationship.PARENT, child))
        self.relations.append((child, Relationship.PARENT, parent))
            

class Research:
    # dependency on a low-level module directly
    # bad because strongly dependent on e.g. storage type

     def __init__(self, relationships):
         # high-level: find all of john's children
         relations = relationships.relations
         for r in relations:
             if r[0].name == 'John' and r[1] == Relationship.PARENT:
                 print(f'John has a child called {r[2].name}.')

```

### Pattern
```python
from abc import abstractmethod

class RelationshipBrowser:
    @abstractmethod
    def find_all_children_of(self, name): 
        pass
    
class Relationships(RelationshipBrowser):  # low-level
    relations = []

    def add_parent_and_child(self, parent, child):
        self.relations.append((parent, Relationship.PARENT, child))
        self.relations.append((child, Relationship.PARENT, parent))
            
    def find_all_children_of(self, name):
        for r in self.relations:
            if r[0].name == name and r[1] == Relationship.PARENT:
                yield r[2].name    
    
class Research:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        for p in browser.find_all_children_of("John"):
            print(f'John has a child called {p}')


parent = Person('John')
child1 = Person('Chris')
child2 = Person('Matt')

# low-level module
relationships = Relationships()
relationships.add_parent_and_child(parent, child1)
relationships.add_parent_and_child(parent, child2)

Research(relationships)
```
